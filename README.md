## What's SpotiFree
SpotiFree is mainly my pet-project to show my skills as a **backend** developer and/or a **DepOps** engineer.
This code is (for now) **not ready** for production, please for your own safety don't use this code in a production environment.

SpotiFree is basically a plateform where you can upload (with youtube) your songs.
Songs are downloaded on the server with an unique id, so if someone tries to add a song from the same video. It will aleready be in the database.
